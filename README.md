# Area-Coverage-Romi
In this experiment, an underwater exploration operation has been emulated. The task of the robot is to explore an undersea area which is believed to contain a sunken ship loaded with treasure. The location of the sunken ship has been narrowed down to an uncharted area within a radius. The robot is not capable of retrieving the treasure; however, it must effectively inform a subsequent recovery team. Recording undersea features, such a prominent rock, undersea pipelines, and scattered ship debris may assist in effectively describing the area and the treasure location. Since the tests are being in a controlled environment, inside a lab, the aforementioned real objects are represented by obstacles, lines and RFID tags respectively.

Objectives
1) To find and implement motion planning and the pattern which the robot follows to explore the environment.
2) To implement accurate kinematics for the robot in order to achieve accurate mapping.
3) To detect and map obstacles and other features on map.

The final project report has been attached.
